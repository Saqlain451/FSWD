        Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company
        Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire sold motorcycles, bicycles,
        lawnmowers and stationary engines which they had manufactured. Enfield
        Cycle Company also used the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal".
        The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. The Enfield Cycle
        Company is responsible for the design and original production of the
        Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.
        Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967,
        which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until their
        closure in early 1971. Enfield's remaining motorcycle business became
        part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business eventually closing in
        1978
